## NIO
### Optimize for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 responses
Motivation:

Its very likely that the response will be HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0 so we can optimize for it by minimizing the buffer.write(...) calls.
Beside this we should also change the pattern of *.write(into: inout ByteBuffer) to extension on ByteBuffer itself.

Modificiations:

- Optimize for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1
- Use extensions on ByteBuffer

Result:

Faster and more clean code.

[apple/swift-nio#300](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/300)

### Add support for automatic HTTP error reporting
Motivation:

Currently the HTTP decoders can throw errors, but they will be ignored
and lead to a simple EOF. That's not ideal: in most cases we should make
a best-effort attempt to send a 4XX error code before we shut the client
down.

Modifications:

Provided a new ChannelHandler that generates 400 errors when the HTTP
decoder fails.
Added a flag to automatically add that handler to the channel pipeline.
Added the handler to the HTTP sample server.
Enabled integration test 12.

Result:

Easier error handling for HTTP servers.
