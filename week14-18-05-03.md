# Week 14

## News
We are back!. A whole lot going on recently. 

## New Features

### Adds implicit map/flatMap return types
One of the advantages of using NIO's futures is that there methods available (```map```,``` then```, etc) that support not passing any explicit type info. Allowing Vapor's methods to better align with those of NIO will make things feel more cohesive. 

```swift
router.get("vapor") { req in
    return try req.client().get("https://vapor.codes").map { res in
        return res.description
    }
}
```

### Add ContentTag
Additional overloads to ```req.content.encode(...)``` were added. These allow for customer coders to be passed in as needed.
