# Week 15

## News
Weekversary of Vapor 3 ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. This week has been particularly interesting because of the amount of articles and tutorials the Vapor Community have contributed with, now Vapor has its own thread at the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/vapor) and most importantly, [Vapor 3.1](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/tree/3.1), yes, you read it right, Vapor's development team is restless already thinking on 3.1, aswesome! is not it?. 

## New Features

### Add a non-variadic 'on' method to router 
Adds a non-variadic overload to ```router.on(...)``` to allow users to easier extend Vapor's router

Creates a `Route` at the provided path using an HTTP method. This return `"Hello, world"` to requests to `GET /hello/world`

```swift
router.on(.GET, at: ["hello", "world"]) { req in
	return "Hello, world!"
}
```
You can use anything `PathComponentsRepresentable` to create the path, including dynamic parameters

```swift
router.on(.GET, at: ["users", Int.parameter]) { req in
	let id = try req.parameters.next(Int.self)
	return "User #\(id)"
}
```
[vapor/vapor#1666](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1666)

### Model cleanup (more than that)
- Cleanup the session persist protocols
- Reduce usage of model to where necessary, adding behavior via extensions
- Allows middlewares to be composed. Fixing [vapor/auth#34](https://github.com/vapor/auth/issues/34)

[vapor/auth#39](https://github.com/vapor/auth/pull/39)

### Export Crypto in Authentication
Export Crypto in ```Authentication``` so using things like the BCryptDigest for setting up a password verifier don't require an ```import Crypto```

## NIO
### Implement lazy selector registration
**Motivation:**

Previously we would eagerly register any fd with the selector
(epoll/kqueue) which works well with kqueue. With epoll however, you'll
get EPOLLHUP immediately if you supplied a socket that hasn't had
connect/bind called on it.
We got away with this because we took quite a bit of care to always make
sure we call connect/bind pretty much immediately after we registered
it. And crucially before we ever asked the selector to tell us about
new events.

**Modifications:**

made selector registration lazy (when we try activating the channel by
calling connect/bind)

**Result:**

the user can now register and connect whenever they feel like it, fixes [apple/swift-nio#380](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues/380)

[apple/swift-nio#388](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/388)

### Add support for compiling and running NIO on Raspberry Pi 32-bit
**Motivation:**

Pretty much every developer in the world want to run MicroExpress applications on Raspberry Pi K8s clusters. The unfortunate precondition to that is getting NIO compiled for RaspberryPi. This PR makes it work.

Thanks go to @chnmrc for providing a Swift 4.1 Raspi build, also available via a DockerHub: helje5/rpi-swift.

**Modifications:**

Two main changes:

- Timestamps used to be stored as Int, this needs to be an explicit Int64 to provide the necessary value range for ns values
- Some hardcoded pointers like 0xdeafbeef got mapped to Int values, but Int32 can't represent 0xdeadbeef. Needs to be UInt32 to capture the full deadness.

**Result:**

NIO compiles on Raspi 3, 32-bit Ubuntu. I tried the Echo Server, which seems to work, and also the HTTP sample Server, which also seems to work.

P.S.: This should also allow you to run NIO on AppleWatch, which is 32-bit too.

## Community Contributions
### Add support for SSL-enabled Postgres servers
- Adds an optional tlsConfiguration property to PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig. An attempt to open an SSL connection will only be made if this is non-nil
- Adds the handshake required by PostgreSQL to check for SSL support
- Uses NIOOpenSSL to add a OpenSSLClientHandler to the PostgresSQLConnection channel pipeline using the aforementioned tlsConfiguration property
- Updates contributing_bootstrap.sh to spin up a second container using a new postgres-ssl Docker image, which creates a self-signed certificate to enable ssl on the Postgres container
- Updates PostgreSQLConnectionTests to add a SSL connection test
