# Week 18

## News

WWDC 18 is around the corner, lots of excitement for the upcoming news and with that in mind our communities are very active to gather us to watch it and enjoy and, of course, talk Vapor. A big shoutout to our Vapor communities in Berlin, London and Tokyo for their plans. Please come and join us! It will be awesome!

## NIO

### Current version [1.7.1](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/1.7.1)

## Community Contributions

### Add support for connecting to a Postgres database via Unix sockets
Unix sockets have lower latency and higher throughput than TCP sockets. There are reports that indicate this to be particularly relevant when using Google Cloud SQL proxy.

### Add RSA encrypt and decrypt and adapt API
Added encrypt and decrypt capabilities to the RSA class. Old APIs deprecated and new methods that take ```DigestAlgorithm``` as parameter.
