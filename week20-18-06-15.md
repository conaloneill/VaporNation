# Week 20

## News

Hello Vapor-heads of the world!. The final Fluent 3 RCs were released this week and it comes with very interesting changes and improvements. 

## New Features

### Add CaseIterable protocol for Swift 4.1

This will allow Fluent to take advantage of CaseIterable when it comes in Swift 4.2.

[vapor/core#157](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/157)

### Fluent 1.0.0 GM + Add Decoders + SQL Updates

[vapor/postgresql#72](https://github.com/vapor/postgresql/pull/72)

## NIO

### Current version [1.8.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/1.8.0)

### Updated http_parser
**Motivation:**

Our copy of ```http_parser``` has become almost a year old now, and there are
both some bugfixes that improve correctness and some performance
improvements in ```http_parser``` that we should pick up.

**Modifications:**

- Updated http_parser
- Added tests to confirm we don't suffer from [nodejs/http-parser#432](https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser/pull/432)
- Added tests that we didn't get broken by SOURCE verb addition.

**Result:**

Shiny new http_parser!

### Created Worker.future() method

Adds a .future() method to the Worker protocol that creates a new, succeeded, future with a Void value.

```let success: Future<Void> = request.future()```

### Added helper method to initialize connection from connection string

```swift
let databaseURL = "mysql://username:password@hostname.com:3306/database"
let config = try MySQLDatabaseConfig(url: databaseURL)
```

[vapor/mysql#177](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/177)

### Added PostgreSQLStringModel

### Make FluentSQLite usable on iOS

The two most popular options for persistence on iOS (Realm and Core Data), both rely heavily on Objective-C, however, SQLite is available.

**Concept:**

```swift
// Shared models package, imported by both client and server
class User: Codable {
  let id: Int?
  let name: String
  let age: Int
}

// Client
extension User: SQLiteModel, Migration {}

// Server
extension User: PostgresModel, Migration {}
```
