# Week 17

## News

New version of SwiftNIO was released this week. Vapor running everywhere, this week Raspberry Pi.

## New Features

### Process async execute

Adds support for asynchronously execute a process. Asynchronously the supplied program in a new process. Stderr and stdout will be supplied to the output closure as it is received. The returned future will finish when the process has terminated.

```swift
let status = try Process.asyncExecute("echo", "hi", on: ...) { output in
    print(output) // ProcessOutput (stderr or stdout)
}.wait()
print(result) // 0
```

## NIO

### Current version [1.7.1](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/1.7.1)

### Rename numThreads to numberOfThreads parameter

**Motivation:**

We should be consistent with naming and also choose descriptive names.

**Modifications:**

Deprecate old init method that uses numThreads
Add new init with numberOfThreads param name
Everywhere use the new init

**Result:**

More consistent and descriptive naming. Fixes [#432](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues/432).

[apple/swift-nio#443](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/443)

### Make removeHandlers public

**Motivation:**

If ```ChannelPipeline.removeHandlers``` is internal it is extremely difficult
to implement a correct ChannelCore.

**Modifications:**

Make ```ChannelPipeline.removeHandlers``` public.

**Result:**

Easier to implement ChannelCore.

[apple/swift-nio#408](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/408)

### Do not allocate String to check if HTTP message is keep alive

**Motivation:**

We can check if a HTTP message is using keep alive without any allocation.

**Modifications:**

Directly act on the internal storage of HTTPHeaders to find out if keep alive is used or not.

**Result:**

Less allocations

[apple/swift-nio#402](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/402)

### Channel quiescing support

**Motivation:**

In certain cases it's useful to quiesce a channel instead of just
closing them immediately for example when receiving a signal.

This lays the groundwork by introducing the ```ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent``` user event that when received can be interpreted by a ChannelHandler in a protocol & application specific way. Some protocols support tear down and that would be a good place to
initiate the tear down.

**Modifications:**

- Introduce ```ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent```
- Handle ```ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent``` in the ```AcceptHandler``` with closing the server socket
- Handle ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent in the HTTPServerPipelineHandler by only handling a already in-flight request and then no longer accepting input

**Result:**

Handlers can now support quiescing

[apple/swift-nio#399](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/399)

### Fix EventLoops that Bootstrap channel initialiser's call out on

**Motivation:**

Previously we were not running the (child/server)channelInitializers on the
event loop associated to the Channel we're initialising. Almost all
operations in there are pipeline modifications which are thread safe so
it presumably wasn't a massive correctness issue. However it's very
expensive to hop threads that often and it is also very unexpected. This
addresses this issue.

**Modifications:**

Made all (child/server)channelInitializers run on the event loop that is
associated to their Channel

**Result:**

- More correctness
- Less unexpected behaviour
- Also seems performance is impacted positively

### Fix numeric with leading zero fractional

Numeric numbers with a fractional part with a leading zero (eg: 10.08) will be decoded from the database without the leading zero (ie: 10.80).

This is a serious issue which results in corrupted numeric values.
