### Make removeHandlers public
**Motivation:**

If ```ChannelPipeline.removeHandlers``` is internal it is extremely difficult
to implement a correct ChannelCore.

**Modifications:**

Make ```ChannelPipeline.removeHandlers``` public.

**Result:**

Easier to implement ChannelCore.

### Do not allocate String to check if HTTP message is keep alive
**Motivation:**

We can check if a HTTP message is using keep alive without any allocation.

**Modifications:**

Directly act on the internal storage of HTTPHeaders to find out if keep alive is used or not.

**Result:**

Less allocations

### Channel quiescing support
**Motivation:**

In certain cases it's useful to quiesce a channel instead of just
closing them immediately for example when receiving a signal.

This lays the groundwork by introducing the ```ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent``` user event that when received can be interpreted by a ChannelHandler in a protocol & application specific way. Some protocols support tear down and that would be a good place to
initiate the tear down.

**Modifications:**

- Introduce ```ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent```
- Handle ```ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent``` in the ```AcceptHandler``` with closing the server socket
- Handle ChannelShouldQuiesceUserEvent in the HTTPServerPipelineHandler by only handling a already in-flight request and then no longer accepting input

**Result:**

Handlers can now support quiescing
